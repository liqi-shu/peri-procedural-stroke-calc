# Brown Peri-procedural Stroke Risk Assessment Tool

## Overview

An evidence-based web calculator for predicting peri-procedural stroke risk in surgical patients. Implements a validated logistic regression model derived from multicenter clinical data (n=255,850).

## Features

- **Real-time risk calculation** with 95% confidence intervals
- **Evidence-based clinical recommendations** based on risk stratification
- **Responsive design** for desktop, tablet, and mobile use
- **No dependencies** - pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Offline capable** after initial load

## Usage

1. Enter patient age (18-120 years)
2. Select applicable medical conditions
3. Choose surgery setting and procedure category
4. Review calculated risk and clinical recommendations

## Risk Categories

- **Low Risk (< 1%)**: Standard monitoring appropriate
- **Moderate Risk (1-5%)**: Enhanced monitoring recommended  
- **High Risk (â‰¥ 5%)**: Intensive monitoring required

## Model Details

**Sample Size**: 255,850 patients  
**Model Type**: Multivariable logistic regression  
**Reference Groups**: Ambulatory Surgery, General Surgery  

### Key Predictors
- Age (continuous)
- Medical conditions: diabetes, hypertension, stroke history, carotid stenosis, intracranial atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation
- Surgery setting: ambulatory, emergency/inpatient, outpatient clinic
- Procedure category: 9 specialty groups (transplant surgery removed)
