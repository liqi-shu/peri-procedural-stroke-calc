# Brown Perioperative Stroke Risk Assessment Tool

## Overview

The Brown Perioperative Stroke Risk Assessment Tool is an evidence-based, web-based clinical decision support system designed to predict the risk of perioperative stroke in patients undergoing surgical procedures. This calculator implements a validated logistic regression model derived from comprehensive multicenter clinical data analysis, providing real-time risk assessment with confidence intervals and evidence-based clinical recommendations.

## Clinical Significance

Perioperative stroke is a serious complication that can significantly impact patient outcomes, healthcare costs, and quality of life. This calculator provides clinicians with a rapid, evidence-based risk assessment tool to:

- **Preoperative Risk Stratification**: Identify high-risk patients requiring enhanced monitoring
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Guide perioperative management decisions and resource allocation
- **Informed Consent**: Facilitate comprehensive patient discussions about stroke risk
- **Quality Improvement**: Support institutional protocols for stroke prevention
- **Research Applications**: Enable standardized risk assessment across institutions

## Methodology

### Data Source and Model Development
The risk prediction model was developed using the Brown University healthcare dataset, a comprehensive multicenter clinical database containing detailed perioperative and outcome data from 2016-2024. The model incorporates validated clinical predictors including:

- **Patient Demographics**: Age (continuous variable)
- **Medical Comorbidities**: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, history of stroke, carotid stenosis, intracranial atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation
- **Surgical Factors**: Surgery/procedure setting (outpatient, in-hospital, office/emergency department), procedure category (9 specialty groups)

### Statistical Methods
- **Model Type**: Multivariable logistic regression
- **Variable Selection**: Stepwise selection with clinical relevance assessment
- **Model Validation**: Internal validation using bootstrap resampling (1000 iterations)
- **Performance Metrics**: Discrimination (c-statistic), calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test), and clinical utility assessment

### Model Performance
The model demonstrates strong predictive performance suitable for clinical implementation:
- **Discrimination**: c-statistic > 0.75
- **Calibration**: Good fit across risk strata
- **Clinical Utility**: Net benefit analysis supports clinical use

## Usage Instructions

### For Healthcare Providers

1. **Enter Patient Age**: Input the patient's age in years (18-120, required field)
2. **Select Medical Conditions**: Check all applicable medical conditions
3. **Choose Surgery Setting**: Select the appropriate surgery/procedure setting
4. **Select Procedure Category**: Choose the relevant surgical specialty category
5. **Review Results**: The calculator displays:
   - Predicted stroke risk percentage
   - 95% confidence interval
   - Evidence-based clinical recommendations

### Interpretation of Results

- **Predicted Stroke Risk**: Point estimate of perioperative stroke probability
- **95% Confidence Interval**: Range of plausible risk values
- **Clinical Recommendations**: Risk-stratified management suggestions

### Risk Categories and Clinical Implications

- **Low Risk (< 1%)**: Standard perioperative monitoring appropriate
- **Moderate Risk (1-5%)**: Enhanced monitoring and stroke-specific protocols recommended
- **High Risk (≥ 5%)**: Intensive monitoring and multidisciplinary consultation required
